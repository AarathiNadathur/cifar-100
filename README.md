#Milestone 1: Perform a binary classification of images in vehicle 1 and vehicle 2 superclass pairs with several traditional machine learning algorithms and CNN.

#Milestone 2: Design algorithms that would be able to predict a sub-class not in the training stage. 1 subclass hidden from each of the two super classes.

#Milestone 3 (Final Report): To perform binary classification of images in vehicle 1 and vehicle 2. The algorithm is tested against hiding 2 sub-classes image data during the training stage.
